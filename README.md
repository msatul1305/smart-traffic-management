With the help of OpenCV, we are able to calculate crowd density and prevent us from traffic congestion.
We are also detecting accidents and providing immediate assisstance without human intervention.
<h3>The problem it solves</h3>
People would be highly benefitted if our solution comes into play. a lot of time would be saved, 
reducing traffic jams and also detecting and providing immediate assisstance to accident victims. 
TensorFlow's Count API and OpenCV helps us to find the intensity of crowd and give more priority
to the higher crowd intensity by changing the traffic signals automatically to green and stopping 
the minimum intensity crowd with red signal.
Our algorithm also detects accidents and other kinds of mishap and 
takes a screenshot and sends it to the emergency services which may include 
Police and Medical department. After getting an immediate request, apt services can be provided to the victims.
<h3>Challenges we ran into</h3>
Deep Learning means hurdles are going to come across. Training a model gets sometimes complicated but we overcame it after trying multiple times and got a good enough model with well accuracy. Taking an image and then uploading it into a website was bit difficult in a single python script. But thanks to Imgur API with their well written documentation which helped us a lot.
